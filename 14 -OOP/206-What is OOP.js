/* 
    âœ… Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concepts of objects
    âœ… We use objects to model (describe) real-world or abstract features
    âœ… Objects may contain data (properties) and code (methods). By using objects, we pack data and the corresponding behavior into one block
    âœ… In OOP, objects are self-contained pieces/blocks of code
    âœ… Objects are building blocks of applications, and interact with another
    âœ… Interactions happen through a public interface (API): methods that the code outside of the object can access and use to communicate with object
    âœ… OOP was developed with the goal of organizing code, to make it more flexible and easier to maintain (avoid spaghetti code)

    ðŸŸ¢ Abstraction: Ignoring or hiding details that don't matter, allowing us to get an overview perspective of the thing we're implementing, instead of messing with details that don't really matter to our implementation

    ðŸŸ¢ Encapsulation: Keeping properties and methods private inside the class, so they are not accessible from outside the class. Some methods can be exposed as a public interface (API)

    ðŸŸ¢ Inheritance: Making all properties and methods of a certain class available to a child class, forming a hierarchial relationship between classes. This allows us to reuse common logic and to model real-world relationships.

    ðŸŸ¢ Polymorphism: A child class can overwrite a method it inherited from a parent class (it's more complex, but enough for our purposes)
