1) We can run parcel with this instruction: npx parcel index.html

2) "start":"parcel index.html" -> we can do it like that: npm run start

3) Parcel actually automatically uses Babel to transpile our code

4) Transpilling is basicly transforming the ES6 syntax to ES5. Polyfilling is transforming the new syntax like find method or Promises to ES5

4) Parcel serves transpilling out of the box but demands another stuff to do polyfilling
